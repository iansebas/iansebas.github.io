# Claude Code Instructions

## Deployment Process

When the user says "deploy", run the following command:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**What this does:**
1. Commits all changes to the `master` branch
2. Pushes code to GitHub
3. Builds the Next.js project with static export
4. Deploys to `gh-pages` branch (which serves the live site at https://iansebas.github.io/)
5. Cleans up build artifacts

**After deployment, ALWAYS verify:**
1. Main site works: https://iansebas.github.io/
2. Resume page works: https://iansebas.github.io/resume/
3. PDF files in public/pdfs/ are accessible at: https://iansebas.github.io/pdfs/filename.pdf
4. Example: https://iansebas.github.io/pdfs/wanderings.pdf

## Important Notes

- The `./deploy.sh` script handles EVERYTHING (code commit + push + deploy)
- GitHub Pages serves from the `gh-pages` branch
- Never use `npm run deploy:ci` unless specifically asked - use `./deploy.sh`
- If deployment fails with "branch already exists" error, run:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules/.cache/gh-pages
  ./deploy.sh
  ```

## PDF Display Features

- Resume is displayed at `/resume` using an embedded iframe
- PDF refreshes automatically on every page visit
- Manual refresh button available
- Download functionality included
- Fallback links if PDF doesn't display

## Directory Structure

- Source code: `master` branch
- Live site: `gh-pages` branch (auto-generated by deployment)
- PDFs: `public/pdfs/` folder â†’ accessible at `/pdfs/filename.pdf` on live site
