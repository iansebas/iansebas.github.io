# ‚ö†Ô∏è AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT TEST SCRIPT ‚ö†Ô∏è
# 
# PURPOSE: Verify deployment process works reliably
# WHAT IT DOES:
# 1. Deploys to live site 
# 2. Verifies main site is accessible
# 3. Reports success/failure with evidence
#
# USAGE: ./test-deployment.sh
# 
# FOR FUTURE CLAUDE: Use this script to verify deployment before claiming it works!
# This prevents overconfident claims without verification.
